## Overview

Vueing-vue is created to help people new to vue get familiar with it. This was made from the knowledge I gathered from [The Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) vue playlist and [Vue Documentation](https://vuejs.org/). Don't mind my wacky design ðŸ˜œ. This repor covers of vue's concept:

- Binding (Class, Style, Two-Way Binding)
- Components
- Props
- Slots
- Mixins
- Router
- Composition API
- and so on...

### Built With

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
